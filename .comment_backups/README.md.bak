# Emmet Hoversten - Recreated Portfolio

This repository recreates the portfolio site from the files you provided. It's a minimal Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

Notes:
- The project uses `@/*` path alias to map to `src/*` (see `jsconfig.json`).
- The `Resume` section embeds a public Google Doc (ID present in the file).
